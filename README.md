# Inspiration

We were inspired by the recent catastrophic flooding in Vermont, home of one of our team. 

Climate change-induced flooding presents a significant and escalating threat to vulnerable communities worldwide. The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall and storm surges, combined with rising sea levels, are exacerbating flood risks and causing extensive damage to infrastructure, property, and human lives. These flooding events not only result in immediate destruction but also have long-term consequences for affected regions, including economic losses, displacement of populations, and adverse impacts on public health and ecosystems. Urgent action is required to develop comprehensive strategies that mitigate the impacts of climate change-related flooding, enhance resilience, and protect vulnerable communities and vital infrastructure from future flood risks.

# What it does

R!SE ABOVE, allows affected communities gain access to a robust network of volunteers, professionals, and resources dedicated to flood recovery and rebuilding efforts. Our user-friendly website serves as a centralized hub where users can request and offer assistance, exchange vital information, and coordinate community-driven initiatives. No community should face the aftermath of a flood alone.

# How we built it

We built R!SE ABOVE using html, css, and deployed our site to GitHub Pages.

# Challenges we ran into

Individual time constraints were our biggest challenge. Neither one of us had as much time as we would have like to develop the site as fully as we would have liked. We would have like to been able to incorporate our logo, have created a database to store user information, and have added an Auth0 sign in page. Additional styling for improved user experience was something we also hoped we had time for.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the concept and existing UI experience and that we were able to deploy our site on GitHub Pages.

# What we learned

We learned to deploy a website on GitHub Pages.

# What's next for Rise Above

We intend to continue to work on R!SE ABOVE and create a fully functional cross platform web application that assists users during floods and other natural disasters in the spirit of mutual aid.
